4. 5 scetches or wireframes of different screens of your app.
5. Scetch or mockup of the logo.
6. Choose an app category.

## Base Score

7/7 = 80%



## Extras

10 - Missing two sketches. As mentioned in HW2's feedback, you're going to need to include a lot of mobile-specific features in this to make it a good final. Otherwise, the grade is likely to be low.
